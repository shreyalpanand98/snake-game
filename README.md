# Snake Game
 This is a code to create one of my favorite childhood snake games

## Instructions to get started
1. Clone the repository on your local desktop/computers
2. Open the file on Visual Studio Code or any other editor.
3. Run the main.py file and get started with the fame.

## Directions to play:
1. Move the snake using up/right/down/left arrow keys on your keyboard.
2. Try to catch the "food" (white dot) on without hitting the walls or the tail of the snake.
3. Earn points to beat your scores.
